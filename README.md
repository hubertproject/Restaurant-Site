# Restaurant-Site

This is my first project utilizing HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. I used Firebase to store the checkout form details and hosted the site on Netlify: [Damas Resto](https://damasresto.netlify.app/).

I began this project in 2022. Initially, my skills were not perfect, but with experience and dedication, I have significantly improved my approach and techniques in web development. Now, I handle similar projects with enhanced expertise and efficiency.
